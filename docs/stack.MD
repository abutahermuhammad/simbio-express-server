# Technology Stack

This document defines the code formatting and patterns details that we will try to follow for this entire application development. We will use the following technologies and tools:

- REST: Express - A web framework for Node.js that allows us to create RESTful APIs and handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Language: TypeScript - A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to enhance code quality and readability.
- Database: PostgreSQL - A relational database system that supports SQL queries and transactions.
- ORM: Prisma - An ORM (object-relational mapping) tool that lets us interact with PostgreSQL using TypeScript models and queries.
- Compression: Brotli/gzip - Compression algorithms that reduce the size of data sent over the network, improving performance and bandwidth usage.
- RPC Framework: gRPC - A framework for remote procedure calls that uses HTTP/2 and protocol buffers to enable fast and efficient communication between microservices.
- Server: NGINX - A web server that can also act as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and cache server.
- Container: Docker - A platform that allows us to package our application and its dependencies into isolated and portable containers that can run on any environment.
- CD/CI: GitHub Action - A workflow automation tool that integrates with GitHub and enables us to perform continuous integration and continuous delivery tasks, such as testing, building, and deploying our code.
- Log: NewRelic - A cloud-based observability platform that helps us monitor and troubleshoot our application performance, errors, and issues.
