# Code Formatting

This document defines the code formatting and patterns details that we will try to follow for this entire application development.

We will use the following resources as references and guidelines for writing clean, readable, and maintainable code:

- [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://github.com/dev-marko/clean-code-book) by Robert C. Martin. This book is a classic in the field of software engineering and provides a comprehensive overview of the principles and practices of writing high-quality code.
- [Clean Code JavaScript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) by Ryan McDermott. This is a GitHub repository that adapts the concepts from Clean Code to JavaScript, the main programming language we will use for this project.
- [Writing clean code: Naming](https://www.codementor.io/@tanakamutakwa/writing-clean-code-naming-1msxn728ht) by Tanaka Mutakwa. This is an article that explains the importance of naming in code and provides some tips and conventions for choosing descriptive and unambiguous names.

Some of the main topics we will cover in this document are:

- Effectiveness, efficiency, and simplicity
- Format and syntax
- Naming
- Conciseness versus clarity
- Re-usability
- Clear flow of execution
- Single responsibility principle
- Having a single source of truth
- Only expose and consume information you need
- Modularization
- Folder structures
- Documentation

We will also use some tools and practices to ensure a consistent and clean codebase, such as:

- Code reviews
- Testing
- Linting
- Formatting
- Refactoring
